CPU STRESS TEST

Using CPU Throttling Test from the Play Store. It runs about 20 threads and keeps all 4 cores at 100%.

Oneplus One, Argon Kernel

** Original Argon thermal files: Steady about 66 degrees

  GIPS: 49K GIPS max, 46K ave, 42K min

** lowX-kernel-thermal: steady at 62-64 degrees, sometimes 65, can rise to 68 after a while
   X = only difference is max_freq, which can only be applied when the CPU is quite cool

  low1 GIPS: 49K GIPS max, 46K ave, 39K min


** medium-low: Goes up to 68-69, 1500-1700, pretty steady

** medium: Goes up to 68-69, 1500-1700, seems steady

** medium-high1: Same

** medium-high2: Same  

   GIPS: 56K GIPS max, 48K ave, 38K min

** high: Immediately crashes/reboots.  This doesn't seem due to thermal issues--it happens too quickly.  Not sure the cause.
